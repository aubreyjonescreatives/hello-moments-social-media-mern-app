## Project Description

### Hello Moments is a social media app that uses the MERN full stack web development process and CRUD system. 

#### With this web app I learned a lot about styling with MUI themes such as light mode and dark mode. I studied how to deploy to Heroku successfully very carefully while learning a lot about CORS and CORP.  


### Enjoy sharing precious moments with your loved ones from all over the world.
